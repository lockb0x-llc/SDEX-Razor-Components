## **How SDEX Razor Tools Complements Previous Projects**

### **1. Integration with Stellar Razor Tools (Pakana)**
The **Stellar Razor Tools (Pakana)** provides a set of **general-purpose Razor components** for interacting with the Stellar network, such as managing accounts, assets, and payments.

- **Trading Functionality:** The SDEX Razor Tools adds a **trading-focused layer** to this foundation, allowing developers to build complete portfolio management and trading apps.
- **Portfolio Management:** Integrating SDEX components with Pakana’s account management tools provides a **holistic view** of a user’s assets and trading history.
- **Consistent UI/UX:** Both toolkits use Razor components, ensuring a seamless experience when combining Pakana with SDEX components in a single application.

### **2. Optimization with Stellar Identity Platform**
The **Stellar DotNet Identity Framework** offers **keypair management**, authentication, and secure transaction handling, which complements the **SDEX Razor Tools**.

- **Secure Trading:** The integration of the Identity Framework with SDEX components allows for **secure transaction signing**, role-based access, and multi-signature handling—essential for secure trading platforms.
- **Authentication & Session Management:** SDEX components can use the Identity Framework’s authentication features to **manage user sessions**, making it easier to build end-user applications with account security and trading combined.
- **Streamlined User Experience:** By enabling seamless integration between **Identity Management** and **SDEX trading**, developers can offer users a **unified experience** for managing accounts, signing transactions, and trading on the SDEX.
